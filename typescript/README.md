# TypeScript Example

This example demos a basic host/remote application with TypeScript.

Note: App1 contains `app2.d.ts` file to inform TypeScript that `"app/Button2"` is a valid import.

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
